      <h3>1.What is a C#?</h3>
      <p>
        C# is a Programming Language developed by Microsoft within its .NET
        framework. C# is an object-oriented-programming language used to
        building a variety of applications include desktop, Web applications,
        Games, Mobile apps and more.

      <h4>2. What is a c# DataType ?</h4>
      <p>
        A data type tells the computer what kind of data you'll store in a
        variable. It helps the computer understand how to handle the data and
        how much memory to allocate for it.<br /><br />
        In C#, there are two main categories of data types: <br />I. Value
        types: These data types store data directly in the stack memory.
        Modifications to them do not affect the original data. Examples of value
        types include: - `int`: Represents integer numbers. - `float`:
        Represents single-precision floating-point numbers. - `double`:
        Represents double-precision floating-point numbers. - `char`: Represents
        a single Unicode character. - `bool`: Represents a Boolean value (true
        or false). - `string`: Represents a sequence of characters. II.
        Reference types: These data types store references to data in the heap
        memory. Modifications to them can affect the original data. Examples of
        reference types include: - Classes: Blueprint for creating objects. -
        Arrays: Collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. -
        Interface: Defines a contract that implementing classes must adhere to.
        - Delegates: Type-safe function pointers that reference methods.
