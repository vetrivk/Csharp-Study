2. What is a c# DataType?
 A data type tells the computer what kind of data you'll store in a variable. It helps the computer understand how to handle the data and how much memory to allocate for it.

In C#, there are two main categories of data types:

 I. Value types: These data types store data directly in the stack memory. Modifications to them do not affect the original data. 

 Examples of value types include:
   - `int`: Represents integer numbers.
   - `float`: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.
   - `double`: Represents double-precision floating-point numbers.
   - `char`: Represents a single Unicode character.
   - `bool`: Represents a Boolean value (true or false).
   - `string`: Represents a sequence of characters.

 II. Reference types: These data types store references to data in the heap memory. Modifications to them can affect the original data. 

 Examples of reference types include:
   - Classes: Blueprint for creating objects.
   - Arrays: Collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Interface: Defines a contract that implementing classes must adhere to.
   - Delegates: Type-safe function pointers that reference methods.
